## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package manager)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/car-rental-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/car-rental-system.git)
    cd car-rental-system
    ```

2.  **Set up virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate or venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command installs all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Secret Key:**
    Flask requires a `SECRET_KEY` for session management (e.g., for flash messages and secure forms).
    **Add this line to your `app.py` file, right after `app = Flask(__name__)`:**
    ```python
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_super_secret_key_here_replace_this_with_a_long_random_string'
    ```
    **IMPORTANT:** For a production environment, generate a truly random and complex key, and ideally manage it via environment variables for security.

5.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6.  **View in browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
    ```
